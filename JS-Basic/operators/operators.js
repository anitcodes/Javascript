//Practice questions of Operators

// 1. Write a program that adds two numbers and prints the result.

// let num1 = 2;
// let num2 = 3;

// let sum = num1 + num2;
// console.log("Sum = " + sum);

//taking input from the user in browser
// let num1 = Number(prompt("Enter the first number: "));
// let num2 = Number(prompt("Enter the second number: "));

// let sum = num1+num2;

// alert("Total Sum = " + sum);

// 2. Use the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.

// const num = 5;
// const result = (num%2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd"; //using ternary operator
// console.log(result);

// 3. What will this return?

// let a = 10;  
// a += 5;             //a = a + 5; -> 10 + 5 = 15
// console.log(a);
